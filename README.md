# Car pool Application

## Description

The Car Pool Application is a mobile ride-sharing platform enabling users to share car rides efficiently and economically. It stands out by allowing real-time route sharing from anywhere, using a unique algorithm to find matching sub-routes, thereby reducing the number of private cars on the roads. This application not only offers ecological and social benefits but also differs significantly from existing car-sharing services by focusing on the dynamic overlapping of routes rather than similar start or end points.
